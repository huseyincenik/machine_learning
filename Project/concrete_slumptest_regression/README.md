Welcome to the Concrete Strength Prediction project! In this project, I have explored a dataset containing various cement properties and slump test metrics to predict 28-day compressive strength.

## Overview

This project focuses on the prediction of concrete strength based on input variables such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, SP (superplasticizer), coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, slump, and flow. Our primary goal is to build a robust predictive model.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: This folder contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- `images/`: Images used in this README.
- `README.md`: You are here! This file contains an overview of the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I performed extensive EDA to understand the data better. Visualizations and insights can be found in the Jupyter notebooks.

## Model Building

I built a predictive model using linear regression and explored regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso. Model evaluation and feature importance analysis are available in the notebooks.

## GitHub and Kaggle

You can find the complete code and analysis on GitHub: [GitHub Repository](GitHub Link)

You can also explore this project on Kaggle: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/huseyincenik/concrete-slump-test-regression)
