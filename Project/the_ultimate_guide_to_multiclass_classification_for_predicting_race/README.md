![anthrotech_blog_ANSUR-vs-ANSUR-2](https://github.com/huseyincenik/machine_learning/assets/127469334/fc43dd1c-dccc-433f-9511-67759d6e916b)

## Overview
The 2012 US Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR II) conducted by the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) from October 2010 to April 2012 is a comprehensive dataset. It represents personnel from the entire US Army force, including the Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard. This dataset includes anthropometric and demographic data, as well as 3D scans of Soldier participants.

Please note that the 3D data are not publicly available to respect the privacy of ANSUR II participants. The data from this survey serve various purposes in equipment design, sizing, and tariffing within the military and have potential applications in the commercial, industrial, and academic sectors.
