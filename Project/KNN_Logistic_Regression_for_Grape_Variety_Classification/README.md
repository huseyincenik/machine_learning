## Table of Contents


## PART - 1: EDA and Graphical Analysis

### Dataset Explanation

In this section, provide an explanation of the dataset used in the project, including its source, content, and relevant features.

### Importing Libraries Needed in This Notebook

List the libraries that are imported for this project and briefly describe their purpose.

### User Defined Functions (DEFs)

If you have created any custom functions for this project, describe them in this section and explain their roles.

### Reading & Understanding Data

Explain how the data is loaded, its structure, and any initial observations or data preprocessing steps.

## PART - 2: Logistic Regression

### Train | Test Split and Scaling

Describe how the data is split into training and testing sets, and if any data scaling is applied.

### Modelling with Pipeline

Explain how the Logistic Regression model is implemented using a pipeline.
