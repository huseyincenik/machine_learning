- Explanation of the dataset's source, purpose, and contents.

## Libraries
I used the following libraries for this project:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## EDA and Data Understanding
In this section, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. We visualized key features and distributions.

## Machine Learning
### Train-Test Split and Data Scaling
I split the data into training and testing sets and applied feature scaling to ensure model performance.

### Modeling
I implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and explained its working principle. KNN was chosen for its suitability for the classification task.

### Model Performance
I evaluated the KNN model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Choosing K Value
I employed the elbow method to determine a reasonable K value for the KNN algorithm.

### Control for Overfitting and Underfitting
I discussed how selecting the right K value helps control overfitting and underfitting.

### Cross Validation
Cross-validation was used to find the optimal K value for the KNN model.

### Grid Search
I used grid search to fine-tune hyperparameters and choose reasonable K values.

### ROC Curves and AUC
I evaluated the model using ROC curves and AUC to assess its performance in binary classification.

## Final Model and Deployment
I presented the final KNN model and discussed considerations for deployment in real-world applications.

## Predictions
With the trained model, new observations can be classified with confidence.
