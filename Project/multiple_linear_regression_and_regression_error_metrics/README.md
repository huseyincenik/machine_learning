Welcome to my project on Multiple Linear Regression and Regression Error! In this notebook, I've explored various aspects of these topics. Let's dive in:

## Dataset Explanation
- I began by providing an overview of the dataset to set the stage for our analysis.

## Importing Libraries Needed in This Notebook
- I imported essential libraries to support the data analysis and modeling process.

## Reading & Understanding Data
- We delved into the data, gaining insights and understanding its structure.

## Distribution of Features
- Visualized the distributions of features for a better grasp of the data.

## Train-Test Split
- Prepared the data for modeling using a train-test split.

## Model Fitting and Compare Actual and Predicted Labels
- Trained a multiple linear regression model and compared actual vs. predicted labels.

## Error Metrics
- Evaluated the model's performance using various error metrics.

## Adjusted R2
- Explored the adjusted R2 to gauge the model's effectiveness.

## What is the concept of punishment for RMSE error metric?
- Discussed the concept of RMSE and how it penalizes larger errors.

## Evaluation Model
- Assessed whether the data is suitable for linear regression.

## Prediction Error for LinearRegression
- Examined prediction errors in the context of linear regression.

## Retraining Model on Full Data
- Fine-tuned the model by retraining it on the full dataset.

## Coefficients
- Explored the coefficients and their significance in the model.

## Prediction on New Data
- Demonstrated how the model predicts labels for new data points.

## The effect of features on the predicted label
- Analyzed how different features impact predictions.
