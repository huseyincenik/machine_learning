# Simple Linear Regression Supervised Model

## Overview

Learn about the basics of simple linear regression through this supervised modeling project. The code includes dataset loading, model training, and evaluation steps for a hands-on experience.

## Content

1. **Dataset Explanation**
2. **Importing Libraries Needed in This Notebook**
3. **Reading & Understanding Data**
4. **Create a New Independent Variable (Feature)**
5. **Which Feature is More Suitable for Linear Regression?**
6. **Plotting the Relationship Between Independent Variable and Dependent Variable**
7. **Correlation Between Independent Variable and Dependent Variable**
8. **Coefficient of Determination (R2)**
9. **Linear Regression (total_spend and sales)**
   - Splitting the Dataset into X (Independent Variables) and y (Dependent Variable)
   - Determination of Coefficients (Slope and Intercept)
   - Why Do We Use the Least Squares Error Method to Find the Regression Line that Best Fits the Data?
   - Prediction with Simple Linear Regression
10. **Linear Regression (TV and Sales)**
    - Determination of Coefficients (Slope and Intercept)

## Conclusion

This project concludes the exploration of simple linear regression, including the determination of coefficients and predictions. For more details, you can check the complete code and analysis in the Jupyter Notebook.
