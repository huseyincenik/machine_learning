Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! Here, I share various Machine Learning projects I've worked on. You can find detailed information about each project, including datasets, code, and results.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It has applications in a wide range of fields, from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and healthcare.

## Projects

1. [üßÆ KNN and üìà Logistic Regression for Grape Variety Classification üçá](Project/KNN_Logistic_Regression_for_Grape_Variety_Classification/): In this project.

2. [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Classification](project/K_Nearest_Neighbors_(KNN)_for_Classification_Fundamentals_and_Applications/):

3. [Concrete Slumptest Regression](project/concrete_slumptest_regression/): I have explored a dataset containing various cement properties and slump test metrics to predict 28-day compressive strength.
