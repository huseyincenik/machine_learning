Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! Here, I share various Machine Learning projects I've worked on. You can find detailed information about each project, including datasets, code, and results.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It has applications in a wide range of fields, from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and healthcare.
